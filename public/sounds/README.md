## Sound Recommendations

- For whale alerts: Look for "whale call" or "sonar ping" sounds
- For mega whale alerts: Look for "whale breach" or "deep ocean" sounds
- For UI clicks: Look for subtle "click" or "button press" sounds

## Note

For the best experience, use short sound effects (1-2 seconds) that won't be too disruptive but will still grab attention for important alerts.
